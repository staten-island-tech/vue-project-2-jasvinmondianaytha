  <main>Welcome to the Safari Zone!</main>

  <p>
    This is a simulation of the safari zone from the generation one pokemon
    games(with some added touches).
  </p>

  <p>
    In the safari zone, you can catch pokemon using safari balls. There is no
    guarantee that you will catch the pokemon, but you will be given tools(rocks
    and bait) to assist you in your endeavors.
  </p>

  <p>
    After you catch the pokemon, you are to take care of that pokemon. You will
    be given a variety of options to do so.
