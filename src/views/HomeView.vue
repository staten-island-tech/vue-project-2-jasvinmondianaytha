  <h1 class="welcome">Welcome to the Safari Zone!</h1>
  <p>
    In the Safari Zone, when a wild Pokémon appears, Trainers cannot send out
    Pokémon to battle it. Instead, Trainers must face Pokémon only with simple
    tools, and catching a Pokémon becomes much more reliant on luck, as Pokémon
    are able to run away from the Trainer at any time. Trainers may throw Bait
    to make a Pokémon less likely to run, but this also makes it harder to
    catch. Conversely, throwing Rocks will make a Pokémon easier to catch but
    more likely to run.

    This is a simulation of the safari zone from the generation one pokemon
    games(with some added touches).

  <p>In addition to catching pokemon, you will need to take care of them.</p>
